write a blog on the diffrence between document and window object ?

window object :
                1. The window is the global element for all objects, functions, etc.
                2. It is an object of the browser.
                3. It represents the browser window in which you are seeing the content.
                4. The properties are stored in the window object.
                5. We can access document object properties inside the window.

        Example: window.document.title will return the title of the document.

 document object :
                  1. document is the root element of the document object model.
                  2. It is an object of window.
                  3. It represents the document loaded inside the window or browser.
                  4. The properties are stored in the document object.
                  5. We can not access windows objects properties inside the document.
           
            Example: document.title will return the title of the document
